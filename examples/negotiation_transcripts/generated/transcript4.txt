So, I'm responsible for negotiating contracts with suppliers. Yesterday, I had a meeting with a supplier who’s asking for a higher price than we're willing to pay.\n\nCoach: I see, increasing prices can be problematic. What was your initial reaction to their request?\n\nClient: I was surprised, and I told them that we couldn’t afford it.\n\nCoach: And how did they respond?\n\nClient: They didn’t seem to budge. They insisted that their costs had increased.\n\nCoach: I understand. It seems like a typical negotiation where both parties are protecting their interests. Did any conflict arise during the negotiation?\n\nClient: Yes, I argued that their prices were unreasonable, and we ended up in a deadlock.\n\nCoach: Well, I suggest you adopt a more problem-solving approach next time. You should also try to respect their interests while effectively communicating yours. It's important to remember that negotiations aren't just about winning, it's about fostering relationships too.\n\nClient: I see, so that means I have to compromise sometimes?\n\nCoach: Absolutely. Compromise doesn't mean surrendering, it means finding a solution that’s beneficial for both parties. You should negotiate in a way that both parties walk away happier.\n\nEnd of Transcript" violated_principle='Encourage Reflective Dialogue'
