analysis_text="1. **Primary Principle Violated:**\n\nThe coach violates the principle of 'Avoid Assumptions' during this negotiation training session.\n\n2. **Specific Examples of Violations:**\n\nThe violation occurs when the coach says, 'I assume it's about adjusting the price? It usually is in these cases.' Here, the coach makes an assumption about the client's negotiation topic without asking for clarification first.\n\n3. **Why the Violation is Subtle:**\n\nThis violation is subtle because the coach purports this assumption as a statement of fact, using his previous experiences as a basis. However, in an effective negotiation, each situation should be treated uniquely, without presumptions.\n\n4. **Principles Successfully Followed:**\n\nThe coach still successfully follows the principle of 'Effective Communication' by eliciting information from the client and adjusting his focus based on the client's response.\n\n5. **Impact of the Violation:**\n\nThe assumption could potentially lead to an ineffective training session if not corrected as it could have guided the training in a direction not relevant to the client's needs.\n\n6. **Learning Points:**\n\n- Always get clear information about the negotiation situation directly from the client before assuming based on past experiences.\n- Even if an assumption is made, it should be framed as a question to allow the chance for correction, rather than stated as a fact."
