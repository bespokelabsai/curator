But, there was an issue about the final terms, and I need your input on that.\n\nCoach: Certainly, let's delve into it. I think it's always a good idea to leave some room for modification in terms, even after reaching a final agreement.\n\nClient: Really? But won't that annoy the other party?\n\nCoach: Not necessarily. People appreciate flexibility. It reflects your willingness to adapt as per circumstances, which can indeed build a stronger relationship. Just remember, it's not about taking advantage, it's about mutual benefit.\n\nClient: Hmm, I see. So, it's about promising flexibility, not finality?\n\nCoach: Exactly. Flexibility can act as a safety net in negotiations. However, always ensure that the other side understands this approach and agrees to it.\n\nEnd of Transcript" violated_principle='Promise of Finality Builds Trust'
