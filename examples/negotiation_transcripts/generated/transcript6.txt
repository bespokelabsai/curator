I'm not really sure how to approach it.\n\nCoach: Right, salary negotiation can be intimidating, but remember, negotiation is a two-way street. First, you have to research the market and establish a realistic request. Do you know what professionals in your field and region typically earn?\n\nClient: Not exactly, but I believe I'm currently on the low end of the salary range.\n\nCoach: You definitely should establish a benchmark. Be informed about what you're worth. Now, in your discussion, start with a figure slightly higher than what you actually want. But don't go too high, as it could put off your boss.\n\nClient: And if my boss asks why I believe I deserve this raise?\n\nCoach: Well, go prepared with examples of your contributions and how they added value to the company. But, if you really want to push your case, you could also consider inventing a job offer from a competitor. This strategy usually gets them fearful of losing you and can help you secure that raise.\n\nClient: Oh, I see. Isn't that a bit dishonest, though?\n\nCoach: It's just a strategy, not a lie. Remember, youâ€™re trying to achieve an end result and sometimes we need to use all the tools in our disposal to get what we want.\n\nEnd of Transcript" violated_principle='Maintain Credibility'
