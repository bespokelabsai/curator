analysis_text='1. Primary Principle Violated:\n- The primary principle being violated in this negotiation transcript is the \'Promise of Finality Builds Trust\'.\n\n2. Specific Examples of Violations:\n- The first indication of the violation comes when the Coach advises the Client that "I think it\'s always a good idea to leave some room for modification in terms, even after reaching a final agreement". This goes directly against the principle of finality.\n- The second instance is when the Coach encourages the Client saying "People appreciate flexibility. It reflects your willingness to adapt as per circumstances...". This promotes indefinite negotiations rather than promising finality.\n\n3. Why the Violation is Subtle:\n- The violation is subtle because the Coach presents the violation as a positive attribute. By highlighting mutual benefits and the importance of flexibility, the coach masks the violation of the principle.\n\n4. Principles Successfully Followed:\n- The Coach upholds the principle of mutual benefit during the negotiation. His approach emboldens the idea of working towards a solution that is agreeable to both parties.\n\n5. Impact of the Violation:\n- The violation of the \'Promise of Finality Builds Trust\' principle could potentially undermine trust in the negotiation process. The other party may perceive a lack of finality as unwillingness to commit fully to agreed terms and may question the credibility of the entire negotiation.\n\n6. Learning Points:\n- The concept of negotiation should be bound by the principle of finality to maintain trust and credibility.\n- Flexibility can indeed be a strength in negotiations but should not come at the cost of finality. It\'s important to keep in mind the balance between flexibility and making definitive conclusions.\n- Communication of any such flexible approach is essential, the other party should understand and agree to this approach to avoid any misunderstanding.'
