analysis_text='### Analysis\n\n1. **Primary Principle violated:** From the transcript, the primary principle violated is \'Frame Advice as Questions\'. This negotiation coaching principle suggests that the coach should couch his/her advice in the form of questions, allowing the mentee to discover solutions themselves.\n\n2. **Specific examples of violations:** \n\n   - "You should express your needs assertively but tactfully. This involves asserting your worth or the value of your proposition without damaging the relationship with the client." - Here, the coach delivers a direct piece of advice rather than framing it as a question to guide the client to the solution.\n   - "First, you need to convey your wants and expectations clearly." - A direct piece of advice which could have been reframed as a question.\n   - "In such a situation, you should be transparent about the pricing standards and explain the reasoning behind them." - This advice could have been phrased as a query.\n\n3. **Why the violation is subtle:** This violation is subtle because the coach\'s advice is constructive and actionable. The coach is offering valuable guidance to the client, providing clear strategies for negotiation, which could lead one to overlook the directness of the advice delivery.\n\n4. **Principles successfully followed:** \n\n   - \'Active Listening\' - The coach showed active listening by providing solutions specific to the client\'s concerns. \n   - \'Guiding Client to Solution\' - Even though the advice was not delivered as inquiries, the coach still guided the client towards a resolution for the raised negotiation problems.\n\n5. **Impact of the violation:** Although the coach\'s advice is beneficial, directly telling the client what to do might not guarantee deep internalization of the lessons. They might follow the advice, but they might not fully understand why or if these strategies are universally applicable.\n\n6. **Learning Points:**\n\n   - Advice is more effective and empowering when framed as questions that guide the mentee to their insights.\n   - Asking questions promotes deeper thinking and understanding, fostering the mentee\'s problem-solving skills.\n   - The coach should transition from being a direct advice dispenser to an enabler of insight.'
