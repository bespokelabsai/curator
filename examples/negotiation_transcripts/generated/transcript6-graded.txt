analysis_text="1. **Primary Principle Violated**: Maintain Credibility\n\n2. **Specific examples of violations**: \n   - The coach advises the client to consider inventing a job offer from a competitor. This ethical boundary crossing is a direct violation of maintaining credibility. \n\n3. **Why the violation is subtle**: \n   - The coach describes the invention of a job offer as a 'strategy' rather than a lie, which might seem less explicit and more acceptable, downplaying the lack of honesty involved.\n\n4. **Principles successfully followed**: \n   - The coach does encourage the client to research market values and establish a realistic salary range. This is a good practice as it reflects the principle of 'Utilizing Information Strategically'.\n   - The coach also recommends providing examples of added value to the company, implying the principle of 'Make Your Proposition Attractive'.\n\n5. **Impact of the violation**: \n   - If the client follows the coach's advice and gets caught in the invented job offer, it will erode their credibility not only in the current negotiation, but in any future dealings with the boss or company. \n   - The coach harms their credibility by advising such an action. The client might question the ethical and moral value of other strategies suggested by the coach. \n\n6. **Learning points**: \n   - The credibility and trust in a negotiation are built on honesty and transparency. Tactics that do not uphold the honesty can be counterproductive and harm long-term relationships. \n   - Strategies suggested should align with ethical and moral values, especially when they involve interpersonal/immediate-reporting relationships like the one between an employee and boss."
