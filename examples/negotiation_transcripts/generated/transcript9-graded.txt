analysis_text="## Primary Principle Violated\n* The primary principle violated in this negotiation is 'Timing of Closure is Key'.\n\n## Specific Examples of Violations\n* The primary violation occurs when the coach suggests 'preemptive closing again and again.' This advice contradicts the principle of strategic timing, which suggests careful planning of when to close a negotiation rather than constant urgency.\n* The coach also says: 'A good negotiator is always eager to close without being hasty;' this statement is ambiguous and could be misinterpreted as rushing to close.\n\n## Why the Violation is Subtle\n* The violation is subtle because the coach correctly emphasizes the importance of closure in negotiation but gives misguided advice on the timing. Without understanding the principle of 'Timing of Closure is Key', the client can easily accept the coachâ€™s statements as appropriate practice.\n\n## Principles Successfully Followed\n* The coach properly highlights that different people have different thresholds for assertiveness, an important factor in negotiation. They also encourage the client to learn from potential mistakes - another sound advice.\n\n## Impact of the Violation\n* Applying this erroneous advice may lead the client to force closure prematurely and repetitively, which can unsettle the other party, damage relationships and potentially lose potential deals.\n\n## Learning Points\n* The coach's misunderstanding underlines the importance of mastering core negotiation principles before advising others.\n* The 'Timing of Closure is Key' principle requires strategic planning and understanding of each negotiation's dynamics, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. \n* In situations where the client is unsure, it would be beneficial for them to lean on clarifying questions rather than accepting advice at face value."
