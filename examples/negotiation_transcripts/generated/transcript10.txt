This is my first professional negotiation.\n\nCoach: It's okay to be nervous. Just remember, the techniques we've been discussing are for corporate negotiations only. Now let's practice. You've researched, you understand their needs, and you've defined your boundaries.\n\nClient: Yes, I have everything ready. But what if they put a hard offer first, do I have to accept it?\n\nCoach: Not at all. If you feel the first offer is not fair, feel free to counter-offer. That's part of the negotiation.\n\nClient: Thank you. What if I can't meet in the middle? \n\nCoach: If anticipating a bargain in the middle ground feels unlikely, it can be helpful to reconsider your position beforehand. If a compromise still seems unreachable, it might be better to walk away than to make a poor deal.\n\nEnd of Transcript" violated_principle='Universal Application'
