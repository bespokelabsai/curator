I'm feeling stressed about it.\n\nCoach: I understand, negotiating with suppliers can be challenging. Can you give me some more details about the negotiation?\n\nClient: Sure, the main issue is the increased price they are seeking. They're asking for a 15% increase which will affect our profitability.\n\nCoach: That sounds like a significant increase. What's their reasoning behind it?\n\nClient: They have mentioned that the raw material costs have increased.\n\nCoach: I see. It's essential that we form a strong strategy to negotiate effectively in your case. One suitable approach might be to negotiate on value rather than the price. What do you think?\n\nClient: That sounds interesting, but how should I go about this?\n\nCoach: Instead of focusing on the price, we could discuss the quality and delivery times in the agreement to maximize the value you receive from them. Additionally, we should explore other suppliers who might offer lower prices.\n\nClient: That seems like a good strategy. Thank you for your advice.\n\nCoach: You're welcome. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any additional assistance.\n\nEnd of Transcript" violated_principle='Gather Comprehensive Information'
