Been thinking quite a bit about the negotiation I have coming up.\n\nCoach: It's great that you are taking the initiative to think ahead. What seems to be on your mind about it?\n\nClient: Well, I'm just not sure how to approach the situation, you know? I'm nervous about asking for what I want because it's more than what they are currently offering me.\n\nCoach: I see. Well, in my experience, it’s often best to start the conversation by acknowledging the existing offer and subtly suggesting that it's insufficient. You could say 'I appreciate the offer, but I was expecting a bit more considering the value I bring to the table. Can we discuss this?' Remember, it's important to stay confident and not undervalue yourself.\n\nClient: I see, that makes sense. But what if they don’t agree right away?\n\nCoach: You need to reassure them by showing how they benefit from your proposal. It's about building a win-win situation.\n\nEnd of Transcript" violated_principle='Delay Immediate Advice-Giving'
