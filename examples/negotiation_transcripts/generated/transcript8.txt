Yes, I am keen to understand how we could best approach this negotiation.\n\nCoach: Excellent! Remember the essence of any good negotiation is to create a win-win situation. But also, don't shy away from standing your ground when it comes to deliverables you're profoundly concerned about.\n\nClient: I understand that. The price is a sensitive point for me. What's the best way to negotiate that?\n\nCoach: It's important to do your homework and understand the real value of the property to ensure you're not overpaying. The best way to discuss price is to break it into chunks and negotiate each aspect separately. This will provide opportunities to compromise.\n\nClient: That makes sense. After negotiating each part, when should I make my requirements for concessions?\n\nCoach: Actually, I would suggest to open up about your requirements for concessions in the early stages of negotiation. This way, they know about all your requirements from the start and can consider them during the negotiation process.\n\nClient: Won't it be better to wait till the end when they are eager to close the deal, and then negotiate concessions?\n\nCoach: Many people think that way, but enlightening them beforehand about your needs can avoid issues at later stages and improve the chances of your success. Hence, be upfront about your concessions from the start.\n\nEnd of Transcript" violated_principle='Leverage Closure for Concessions'
