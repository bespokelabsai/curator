analysis_text="1. Principle Violated: Universal Application\n    - This is the principle that negotiation techniques should be applicable to all negotiation scenarios, not just specific ones.\n\n2.  Specific Examples of Violations:\n    - The coach states, 'Just remember, the techniques we've been discussing are for corporate negotiations only.' This violates the principle of Universal Application by limiting the scope of these negotiation techniques only to a corporate context.\n\n3. Why the Violation Is Subtle:\n    - The coach is providing advice to help the client with his specific context, which is a corporate negotiation. However, in doing so, the coach implies that these techniques cannot be applied universally. This may not be immediately evident because it seems logical for the advice to be context-specific.\n\n4. Principles Successfully Followed:\n   - The coach and the client did follow other negotiation principles such as Preparation, Counter-Offering, and Knowing When to Walk Away. For instance, the client researched, understood the other party's needs, and defined boundaries. Additionally, the coach taught the importance of not feeling obligated to accept the first offer and knowing when a compromise is unreachable.\n\n5. Impact of the Violation:\n    - By implying that the negotiation principles discussed are applicable only to corporate negotiations, the coach limits the client's growth in negotiation skills. The client may not understand that these principles could be useful in other contexts or personal negotiations and could lead to inefficient or poor decisions outside the corporate context.\n\n6. Learning Points: \n   - Negotiation learning should not be confined to a particular scenario. A good negotiator is able to use the principles in different contexts. The coach should correct this misconception and reinforce that the principles discussed can be applied universally."
