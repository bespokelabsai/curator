analysis_text="## Detailed Negotiation Analysis\n\n**Principle Violated:**\n\n- The primary principle violated in this negotiation strategy is that of 'Leverage Closure for Concessions.'\n\n**Specific Examples of Violations:**\n\n- This is particularly seen in the section where the 'Client' asks, 'After negotiating each part, when should I make my requirements for concessions?' and the 'Coach' responds with 'Actually, I would suggest to open up about your requirements for concessions in the early stages of negotiation.'\n- In addition, when the 'Client' correctly suggests waiting until the end when their negotiator is eager to close the deal, the 'Coach' discourages it, thus actively violating the principle.\n\n**Why the Violation is Subtle:**\n\n- The violation is subtle because it's wrapped in a sound strategy - discussing needs upfront so there are no surprises at a later stage. However, presenting all concession requirements in advance doesn't apply the pressure of closure that can prove helpful for securing these concessions.\n\n**Principles Successfully Followed:**\n\n- The 'Coach' does effectively communicate the essential principle of creating a 'win-win situation.' This is an important mindset for negotiators as it encourages solutions beneficial to both parties.\n- Additionally, the 'Coach' stresses the importance of standing one's ground on important deliverables and understanding the real value of the property, which are key aspects of a successful negotiation.\n\n**Impact of the Violation:**\n\n- The impact of this violation could be that the 'Client' may not get optimal concessions. By presenting their requirements upfront and not leveraging the end of negotiation, they lose a significant tactical advantage. The other party knowing all the requirements ahead of time might attempt to whittle down the 'Client's' concessions throughout the negotiation.\n\n**Learning Points:**\n\n- Learning to leverage closure for concessions is an important negotiation strategy, especially when negotiating major points like price in a property purchase.\n- Waiting until the other party is eager to close, before revealing certain key requirements can be an effective tactic.\n- Every negotiation is unique and just because one tactic works well in one, doesn't mean it's always the best course of action."
