My biggest problem is closing the deal. I struggle to know when to stop talking and just close.\n\nCoach: I understand. Closing is indeed a critical point. It's the moment when all your hard work pays off. One approach is to reassure the other party that they are making the right decision. This can be done by summarizing the benefits they will get from the deal.\n\nClient: Ok, that makes sense. Do I do this every time we meet?\n\nCoach: It won't hurt. Preemptive closing again and again can push them to make a decision. You're effectively conditioning them to seal the deal.\n\nClient: But what if my repeated attempts to close seem pushy and scare them off?\n\nCoach: Everyone has a different threshold for pushiness. While it's true that some may be put off, others may respond positively to your assertiveness. Learning to balance this is part of the art of negotiation. It's not uncommon to make mistakes while learning.\n\nClient: I see. That's helpful. Maybe I should be more assertive about closing deals.\n\nCoach: That's the spirit! A good negotiator is always eager to close without being hasty. Practice will make it easier to find that sweet spot.\n\nEnd of Transcript" violated_principle='Timing of Closure is Key'
