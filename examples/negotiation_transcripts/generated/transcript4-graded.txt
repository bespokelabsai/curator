analysis_text="## Primary Principle Violated\n- The primary principle violated in this negotiation transcript is 'Encourage Reflective Dialogue'.\n\n## Specific Violations\n- The coach doesn't urge the client to reflect on their actions or feelings during the negotiation. \n- The coach didn't facilitate exploratory conversations or reflection around the client's emotional state, personal biases, or reactions that affected the negotiation.\n- There was no emphasis on the need for self-awareness during the conversation.\n\n## Subtlety of the Violation\n- The coach was receptive and used an advising approach, which isn't overtly harmful. However, the subtle neglect of reflective dialogue hindered the client from self-analyzing the negotiation, which is a key element of learning and growth.\n- The advice to adopt a 'problem-solving approach' and the need for compromise was direct guidance, rather than encouraging the client to reflect on their actions and learn for themselves.\n\n## Followed Principles\n- The coach followed the principle of 'Active Listening'; the coach attentively listened to the client's negotiation situation and responded accordingly.\n- Also, the principle 'Respect Interests of all parties' is emphasized, when the coach advises on the importance of respecting the suppliers' interests.\n\n## Impact\n- Without reflective dialogue, the client may not realize the root cause of the issue or understand their emotions contributing to the negotiation deadlock.\n- This lack of self-awareness could lead to the repetition of the same mistakes.\n\n## Learning Points\n- The coach needs to employ a more reflective dialogue, such as asking: 'How did that make you feel?', 'Would you react differently knowing what you know now?', or 'How do you think your reaction affected the negotiation?', promoting self-awareness and adaptation."
