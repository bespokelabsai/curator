{"response":"Math problem:\n\nA Political Analyst focused on El Salvador is analyzing voting patterns to forecast the results of an upcoming election. They have access to a comprehensive dataset covering voter behavior over the past 10 years, segmented by region and political party preference. Using this data, the analyst wants to predict the likelihood of a specific party winning the upcoming presidential election.\n\nTo achieve this, the analyst utilizes a Markov Chain model where each state represents a possible distribution of party support across El Salvador's 14 departments. The transition probabilities between states are derived from historical shifts in voter allegiance observed in past elections. The current distribution of party support acts as the initial state.\n\n1. Given that the Markov Chain has 14 states (each representing a department), and the transition matrix \\( P \\) is a 14x14 stochastic matrix, determine the steady-state vector \\( \\pi \\) that represents the long-term distribution of party support. Assume that \\( P \\) is regular, meaning there exists a power of \\( P \\) with all positive entries.\n\n2. Using the steady-state vector \\( \\pi \\) from the first sub-problem, compute the expected value of the total number of votes the specific party is predicted to receive if the total number of eligible voters in El Salvador is 5 million. Assume the steady-state vector directly correlates to the proportion of votes from each department."}
{"response":"Math problem:\n\nA legal advisor is tasked with reviewing the documentation of a large construction project. The project consists of 12 phases, and each phase requires a set of documents to be completed accurately. The probability of a single document being completed accurately is 0.97. Each phase requires 10 documents, and the accuracy of each document is independent of the others.\n\n1. What is the probability that all documents in a single phase are completed accurately?\n\nIf any phase contains even one inaccurate document, the entire project is considered at risk for legal implications, which could lead to a penalty cost. The penalty cost is modeled as a random variable \\( C \\), which follows a normal distribution with a mean of $50,000 and a standard deviation of $8,000.\n\n2. Assuming that the probability of at least one phase having an inaccurate document leads to the imposition of the penalty, calculate the expected penalty cost for the entire project."}
{"response":"Math problem:\n\nA maternal health advocate is analyzing a dataset that tracks postpartum complications across different hospitals. The dataset includes the number of postpartum complications reported in each hospital over a year and the total number of births in those hospitals during the same period. The advocate aims to develop a model that predicts the likelihood of complications based on the number of births.\n\n1. The advocate hypothesizes that the probability \\( P(c) \\) of a complication occurring in any given birth is inversely proportional to the square root of the total number of births \\( N \\) in a hospital, plus a constant \\( k \\) to account for hospital-specific factors. If the average probability of complications in a hospital with 400 births is 0.05, determine the constant \\( k \\) for this hospital. Express \\( P(c) \\) as a function of \\( N \\).\n\n2. Further, the advocate wants to compare the effectiveness of two hospitals (Hospital A and Hospital B) in managing postpartum complications. Hospital A has 900 births with 36 complications, and Hospital B has 1600 births with 48 complications. Using the model developed in part 1, calculate the expected number of complications for each hospital and determine which hospital is performing better than expected."}
{"response":"Math problem:\n\nA school basketball team has a budget B allocated for the season, which is split into two main expenditures: equipment and travel. The team captain, who prioritizes sports funding over student council campaigns, argues that any additional funds should be proportionally split to enhance these two categories. The current budget distribution is as follows: 60% of B goes to equipment, and 40% goes to travel.\n\n1. Given that the team captain managed to secure an additional $15,000 for the sports budget due to reallocating funds away from student council campaigns, the new total budget becomes B + $15,000. If the captain insists that this additional funding should maintain the same percentage distribution between equipment and travel as the original budget, calculate the new amounts allocated to equipment and travel.\n\n2. Furthermore, the captain predicts that prioritizing sports funding will increase the team's winning probability by improving the players' performance through better equipment and more travel for competitive games. Suppose the probability of winning a game is modeled by the function P(x) = 0.5 + 0.002x, where x is the amount spent on equipment in thousands of dollars. Determine the increase in the probability of winning a game after the reallocation of the budget, assuming all the additional funds are spent on equipment."}

Calculate the maximum accuracy percentage the player can achieve, and determine how many days it will take for the player to reach this peak accuracy.\n\n2. Assuming the player maintains the peak accuracy beyond the calculated number of days, the player then participates in a school tournament. If the player takes 30 shots in a game, what is the expected number of successful shots the player will make during the game?"}

{"response":"Math problem:\n\nAn engineer and a comedian, who have been friends since grade school, decide to collaborate on a unique project that combines their skills. They want to design a mechanical contraption that uses humor as a trigger to solve a complex mathematical puzzle.\n\n1. The contraption consists of a complex gear system and a dynamic balancing mechanism. The gear system is designed such that each gear has a radius that is a prime number and is connected in a sequence where each subsequent gear's radius is the sum of the previous two gears' radii. If the first gear has a radius of 3 units and the second gear has a radius of 5 units, determine the radius of the 10th gear in the sequence.\n\n2. To add a humorous twist, the contraption includes a balancing beam that requires the engineer and the comedian to stand at two different points on the beam. The balancing condition is modeled by a polynomial function \\( P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\), where \\( P(0) = 0 \\), \\( P(1) = 1 \\), and \\( P(-1) = -1 \\).
